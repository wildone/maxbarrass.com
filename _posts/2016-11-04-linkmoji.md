These guys wrote this service in an hour very impressive :)

Also, you can use emoji's in you article url's and  I use this [list of emoji's](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) to create URL and add some punch to my articles.

You can check [source](https://github.com/wildone/maxbarrass.com/blob/master/_posts/2016-11-04-linkmoji.md) of this article to see how it's done.

Let the linkmoji make your articles standout!
