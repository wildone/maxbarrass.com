I've installed office 2013 Preview and found one of my projects not working in my case it was WebBrowser component. Well turns out bunch of ActiveX controls are disabled to protect you from yourself. But nothing to complicated that a bit of registry magic did not fix.

The key and value is:

```html
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\COM Compatibility\{8856F961-340A-11D0-A96B-00C04FD705A2}]
"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000000
```


If you don't do this you will get a surprisingly detailed message: "The subject is not trusted for the specified action." to get you started with your investigation! :) Oh and you don't even need to restart anything... it just works... like magic....
