More than a year ago I set off on a journey to build a custom PC Case, that journey lead me to building a water-cooled monolith. Initial requirements were to ensure that the rig would be scalable to the ever changing hardware market and have capacity to manage the ever increasing heat loads of performance hardware components, for that reason the journey was to build a tri-water-loop rig that can be adjusted for different hardware configurations. Just to recap on the project here is the list of things that were done:

- New holes for fill ports
- PSU Mounting hole
- Case sandblasted and powder-coated black
- Majority of wiring re-done and cable sleeved
- Custom temperature indicators mountâ€™s for front panel
- Custom fan control mount on front panel
- Copper loops constructed, polished and lacquered
- Custom UV light switches mounted on rear
- Custom external fan connectors mounted on rear

Next step is to choose the components that can complement this beast! Any suggestions are welcome, prices are estimates will be looking for a best deal.
