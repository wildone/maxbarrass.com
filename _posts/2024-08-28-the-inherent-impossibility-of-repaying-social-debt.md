The society from which we inherit benefits is, in many ways, a product of the past, and the individuals and communities that created it are no longer present to receive repayment. This raises an important philosophical point about the nature of social debt and how it can or cannot be repaid. Here's how this can be framed:

## Inherited Benefits from the Past

The infrastructure, knowledge, cultural heritage, and societal systems we benefit from today were developed by countless individuals in the past. These contributors are no longer present, making direct repayment to them impossible.

## Transgenerational Reciprocity

Since the creators of the society we inherit are from the past and cannot directly benefit from any repayment, the concept of social debt shifts from direct reciprocity to a transgenerational responsibility. This responsibility involves contributing to society in a way that ensures future generations can continue to benefit, just as we have.

## Procreation as Continuation

Procreation can be seen as a way to extend the societal benefits we’ve inherited to future generations, effectively keeping the cycle of societal contribution alive. Although we cannot repay those from the past, we contribute by enabling future generations to inherit, sustain, and enhance the society we live in.

## Sustaining the Chain of Inheritance

By having children and raising them to be responsible members of society, we contribute to the continuation and evolution of the societal framework. This act doesn’t repay the past but honors the legacy left to us by ensuring its benefits are passed forward, rather than allowing them to dissipate.

In this view, while it's impossible to repay social debt to those who created the society we inherited, the ethical response is to ensure that the benefits and structures we’ve received are maintained and improved for those who come after us. This approach emphasizes the moral duty to sustain the societal cycle rather than attempting to repay an unpayable debt to the past.
