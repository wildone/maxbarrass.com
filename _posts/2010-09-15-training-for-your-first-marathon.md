I remember starting out training for my first marathon not long just over 8 months ago now, never ran long distance before that, never thought I could but was fortunate to have some people around me who helped me with some words of wisdom. I followed the LSD style of running to prepare for the marathon (see "LSD Running Schedule"), did core workouts once a week on easy runs usually Mon or Wed (see "Sparta Run").

This is what I did to prepare:

1. Got a running schedule.
2. Followed the running schedule.
3. Kept in mind that its not about me and what I think I need, its about sticking to the running schedule.
4. Listened to my body and rested when needed did not play catchup with schedule, if i missed a session I just did the next one when it was due.
5. Joined a running group its free and gave me lots of opportunity to gauge my ability and helped me to run with other people. (crosbiecrew.net)
