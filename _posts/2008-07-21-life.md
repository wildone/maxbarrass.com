Was doing a bit of pondering yesterday, on life, as you do.The main point that was constantly being in the spotlight is the inability to control your thoughts.The fact that your thoughts are controlled not by you but by the reality you actively participate in. This paradox reminded me of the works done by Marx, and what do you know found a great passage from him that highlight exact same conundrum:

- It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness.(Karl Marx, Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy)

... it would be interesting to see how much of this extends to your subconscious to ease your participation.
