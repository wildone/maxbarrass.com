# Intro 

I wanted to download some podcasts from an RSS feed, here is how to do this with help of RSS, XML Tools and JDownloader (be care full downloading this, Ill make a safe source verison of this some day)

To do this I just transformed the RSS into a list of good URLS with appended #TITLE and used JDownloaded Packagizer Rule to rename downloaded fiels.

# RSS Source
https://feeds.megaphone.fm/WWO4858695911

This source has a bunch of generated names but I want to use "# - Title" as good file name.

# XSLT for RSS 

You can run it here https://maxbarrass.com/tools/xml-transform, download the RSS source and transform it, you will get a list of urls with #title, we will use this # in jdownloader to create proper names for files.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="2.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">
  <xsl:output method="xml" omit-xml-declaration="yes" indent="yes" encoding="utf-16"/>
  <xsl:template match="/">
    <xsl:apply-templates/>
  </xsl:template>
  <xsl:template match="//channel">
<xsl:for-each select="//item">
<xsl:apply-templates select="enclosure/@url" mode="fixtext"/>
                <xsl:text>#</xsl:text>
          <xsl:if test="not(string(itunes:episode))">
         <xsl:value-of select="concat(normalize-space(title),'.mp3')"/>
        </xsl:if>
        <xsl:if test="string(itunes:episode)">
         <xsl:value-of select="concat(itunes:episode,' - ',normalize-space(title),'.mp3')"/>
        </xsl:if>
      <xsl:text>
</xsl:text>
    </xsl:for-each>
  </xsl:template>
  <xsl:template match="*" mode="fixtext" >
<xsl:value-of select="normalize-space(.)" />
  </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
```

# Jdownloader Setup

Packegizer rule - HTML RSS Links
- If
  - Sourceurls(s) using Regex: .*#(.*)
    - this will split url into group wich will be everything after #
- Then
  - Filename: <jd:source:1>
    - this will grab proper name for our download file
    
    
Thats all save and copy your link you will now see a list of RSS link to download with proper titles.
