This raises an important philosophical point about the nature of social debt and how it can or cannot be repaid. Here’s how this can be framed:</p>

<h2 id="inherited-benefits-from-the-past">Inherited Benefits from the Past</h2>

<p>The infrastructure, knowledge, cultural heritage, and societal systems we benefit from today were developed by countless individuals in the past. These contributors are no longer present, making direct repayment to them impossible.</p>

<h2 id="transgenerational-reciprocity">Transgenerational Reciprocity</h2>

<p>Since the creators of the society we inherit are from the past and cannot directly benefit from any repayment, the concept of social debt shifts from direct reciprocity to a transgenerational responsibility. This responsibility involves contributing to society in a way that ensures future generations can continue to benefit, just as we have.</p>

<h2 id="procreation-as-continuation">Procreation as Continuation</h2>

<p>Procreation can be seen as a way to extend the societal benefits we’ve inherited to future generations, effectively keeping the cycle of societal contribution alive. Although we cannot repay those from the past, we contribute by enabling future generations to inherit, sustain, and enhance the society we live in.</p>

<h2 id="sustaining-the-chain-of-inheritance">Sustaining the Chain of Inheritance</h2>

<p>By having children and raising them to be responsible members of society, we contribute to the continuation and evolution of the societal framework. This act doesn’t repay the past but honors the legacy left to us by ensuring its benefits are passed forward, rather than allowing them to dissipate.</p>

<p>In this view, while it’s impossible to repay social debt to those who created the society we inherited, the ethical response is to ensure that the benefits and structures we’ve received are maintained and improved for those who come after us. This approach emphasizes the moral duty to sustain the societal cycle rather than attempting to repay an unpayable debt to the past.</p>]]></content><author><name>Max Barrass</name><email>me@maxbarrass.com</email><uri>http://maxbarrass.com</uri></author><category term="blog" /><category term="philosophy" /><category term="society" /><category term="ethics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The society from which we inherit benefits is, in many ways, a product of the past, and the individuals and communities that created it are no longer present to receive repayment.

<p>It would be amazing if everyone would go out and buy the latest PC’s with the latest TPM and latest CPU and install windows 11 on it following the supported pathway. Well, in reality, most people will update their existing Windows 10 to Windows 11; that’s just logical, right?</p>

<p>So this is my case; I have updated my registry to allow installation with unsupported CPU as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup]
"AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU"=dword:00000001
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Downloaded an ISO from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11">Micorosfts Download Windows 11</a> and created a USB using <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">Rufus</a>. Then I started setup from the USB and waited patiently for the 100% on this screen:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/windows11upgrade/windows-11-setup-progress.png" alt="Windows 11 setup progress" /></p>

<p>Not surprisingly, this screen closed and just gave me an good-old self explanatory error message:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/windows11upgrade/windows-11-installation-has-failed.png" alt="Windows 11 installation has failed" /></p>

<p>Typical as it is, googling will not help; no one knows why it is failing on my PC.</p>

<p>In this case, Uncle Bill is relying on you to fix your problem, as he has already given you all the tools and give you all the bread crumbs to follow.</p>

<p>So let’s see if you can find your issue and fix it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>open Event Viewer</li>
  <li>open Application Log</li>
  <li>start at the top and look for information entry for the upgrade process failure (yeah, breadcrumbs)</li>
  <li>when you find the log entry, it should list a bunch of log files, open the top Setup log file</li>
  <li>scroll to the bottom of the setup log file and scroll up slowly, looking for ERROR lines; you can also search for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aborting</code> keyword from the bottom up</li>
  <li>now you should be finding some real breadcrumbs</li>
</ul>

<p>The log should tell you why it aborted the install. The reasons for this are specific to your PC, so you would need to do some googling to fix them.</p>

<p>My setup aborted because it detected a duplicate account without a profile, so I deleted that in the registry, restarted and ran the install successfully. You should be able to google all the issues that will appear in the log and fix them one by one. I feel that the upgrade process is probably the same as the old process, so it’s going to have similar issues and existing solutions.</p>

<p>I hope this will help; leave a comment if it did, or leave your errors for others to know about.</p>]]></content><author><name>Max Barrass</name><email>me@maxbarrass.com</email><uri>http://maxbarrass.com</uri></author><category term="blog" /><category term="windows-11" /><category term="setup" /><category term="failed" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have been attempting to upgrade to Windows 11 and having issues then read on!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Google Photos Metadata 😗😙😚</title><link href="https://maxbarrass.com/blog/2020/05/21/google-photos-metadata%F0%9F%98%97%F0%9F%98%99%F0%9F%98%9A" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google Photos Metadata 😗😙😚" /><published>2020-05-20T23:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-05-22T00:54:22+10:00</updated><id>https://maxbarrass.com/blog/2020/05/21/google-photos-metadata</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://maxbarrass.com/blog/2020/05/21/google-photos-metadata%F0%9F%98%97%F0%9F%98%99%F0%9F%98%9A"><![CDATA[<p>My cousin Anton, in Moscow, and I making a cross-continental photo album. We have started scanning some old photos so that we can preserve the memory of our ancestors for generations.</p>

<p>We have all the latest scanning technology that black market offers. And we have managed to acquire all the photos we need to scan. Now the question is, how do we search for codes and text content that we want to preserve with the photos.</p>

<p>Well after a round of googling, it’s apparent that this information needs to be purchased from your favourite neighbourhood black market. After that, it turns out that, just setting properties on the file using your favourite windows file properties box, you can update file metadata.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/google-photos-metadata/FileProperties.png" alt="File Properties" /></p>

<p>When you upload the photo back to google drive, the only file property that will appear in Google is the Title property.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/google-photos-metadata/file-with-properties-in-google-photos.jpg" alt="File with properties in google photos" /></p>

<p>For us, this will be enough to smuggle additional information with the image. Here you can checkout the metadata on this image.</p>

<p>Once you have done this, you can do a search to test your handy work.</p>

<p>I wanted to download some podcasts from an RSS feed, here is how to do this with help of RSS, XML Tools and JDownloader (be care full downloading this, Ill make a safe source verison of this some day)</p>

<p>To do this I just transformed the RSS into a list of good URLS with appended #TITLE and used JDownloaded Packagizer Rule to rename downloaded fiels.</p>

<h1 id="rss-source">RSS Source</h1>
<p>https://feeds.megaphone.fm/WWO4858695911</p>

<p>This source has a bunch of generated names but I want to use “# - Title” as good file name.</p>

<h1 id="xslt-for-rss">XSLT for RSS</h1>

<p>You can run it here https://maxbarrass.com/tools/xml-transform, download the RSS source and transform it, you will get a list of urls with #title, we will use this # in jdownloader to create proper names for files.</p>

<p>Let the linkmoji make your articles standout!</p>]]></content><author><name>Max Barrass</name><email>me@maxbarrass.com</email><uri>http://maxbarrass.com</uri></author><category term="blog" /><category term="linkmoji" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linkmoji!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">AEM Capability Matrix</title><link href="https://maxbarrass.com/blog/2015/06/01/aem-capability-matrix" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AEM Capability Matrix" /><published>2015-05-31T23:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2020-05-22T00:10:46+10:00</updated><id>https://maxbarrass.com/blog/2015/06/01/aem-capability-matrix</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://maxbarrass.com/blog/2015/06/01/aem-capability-matrix"><![CDATA[<p>I always get asked does AEM has any components that come out of the box (OOTB)? What is the list of OOTB component?  Can I use them?</p>

<p>A lot of people don’t know and believe that AEM is a blank canvas and you just start from scratch. Obviously this assumptions are built on other platform people have used in the past. Now of course I would not be writing this if this was the case, but it can be cumbersome to get hand on this information.</p>

<p>Anyways, YES AEM does have OOTB component and yes you can use them for your projects and I would recommend use and build on them as needed. Primary reasons is that OOTB components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>can and will save you development work</li>
  <li>already have a Authoring Experience which you should pay attention to, as they already have tried and tested pattern that you should look at adopting. If you don’t consider them you end up with building lots of components with totally disconnected authoring experiences across components and you won’t be able to train your Authors how to use each and every component.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now before you jump in I suggest read additional information about AEM so that you understand AEM terminology etc:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/develop/components.html">What is a component?</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/develop/the-basics/templates.html">What is a template?</a> (you must not have a lot of these in CMS)</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/author/page-authoring/default-components.html">Default components in AEM</a> - You will notice that list on Adobe site is very short.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/develop/extending/granite/granite-reference.html">Granite UI Reference</a> -  When you want to build and update  new Authoring Experiences in “Touch UI”</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/develop/the-basics/touch-ui-concepts.html">Touch UI Concepts</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/develop/components/widgets.html">Classic UI Widgets</a> - Updating Classic UI</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-1/ref/widgets-api/index.html">Classic UI Widgets API Library</a>  - more detailed widget API reference</li>
</ul>

<p>So finally have had some time to compile and publish this list. This list is a combination of all components available in the Design Mode in each of the AEM version.</p>

<p>In addition to this many clients I have spoken to always ask about AEM Capabilities and Features, so I have started to put together a list of these so that it can be used for all sorts of Strategic and Analytical work.</p>

<p>You could use this list to drive your Discovery of AEM and use it to compare AEM to other CMS platform.</p>

<p>The document is located here please feel free to have a look and add comments if you wish:</p>

<p>A good example of why you would extend would be if you have searches that search cq:Page and cq:PageContent at the same time, or you may have multilevel search requirement and you are tempted to do traditional subquery mechanism. In this scenario you can just create an index with all the attributes you want to use for search.</p>

<p>Do note that the more indexes the more space this will take up. Also if you have a large dataset this will take a long time to create, so you need to think about this early on.</p>

<p>Location for the config:</p>

<p>Two things you maybe wondering, number one how to use the Operations on a predicate and second how to do full text case insensitive search on attributes. Well without any further ado:</p>

Just after I started running 3 years ago and before my first marathon I bough my self a training watch and a GPS from Polar. The version at the time I settled for was RXS800 with a matching GPS unit. That watch saw me though my first marathon, several races, athletics events and another 3 marathons. I think it was a worthy investment now that I look over the amount of activities I accumulated in the Polar Pro Trainer.</p>

<p>Despite the times that Polar saw me though, before my last marathon I switched to a Garmin 900xt, this was largely because the GPS unit on Polar take way to long to find satellites, its not water-off (more on this later) and its separate from the watch (only so many times half way though your run you realize that GPS is back home and then you look with envy at all the Garmin users).</p>

<p>The GPS unit for Polar run of a AA battery, which you have to make sure you charge pretty much before each run. The unit it self gives you little indication that it will run out of juice by the time you are done. As I mentioned earlier its not actually water proof. I would say its splash proof, submersion proof or what ever you want to call it, but as long as it describes the usage withing first ~50 battery replacements after coming out of the box. This is is because after a while the O-ring on the round battery door stops being effective, as the whole door comes out! After this happens and you get it wet it turns into a paperweight.</p>

<p>Moving right along, I’ve switched to Garmin, I use their Garmin online offering [1] and I sync activities to Strava [2] automatically [3]! Cool right! Yes, but. All my polar activities still sat in the Polar Pro Trainer, which is a desktop software, its ok but in this day and age its a little 90’s nostalgia. I’ve tried Polar’s online offering and its not Garmin and its not Strava, its clinically sterile which is not always about fun.</p>

<p>Anyways, my transition Polar and Garmin was quick and it did not effect my training, but I can say that much for the amount of exercise data that I collected in the Polar Pro Trainer. There is no actual working migration tools available to do this painlessly and I did not want to write one. I tried all the tools available on both  Mac and Windows including import and cleanup mechanisms and found the following process to work like a charm.</p>

<p>Over all process is to convert your Polar GPX and HRM files to TCX files [4] then import them into Garmin’s Training Center [5], then use Garmin Training Center and upload those activities in bulk to Garmin and you are in business! If you are syncing from Garmin to Strava [3], go to Garmin and set default activity privacy to Everyone before you do a bulk upload from Garmin Training Center. This will save you lots of time after :)</p>

<p>Good luck and keep running!</p>
